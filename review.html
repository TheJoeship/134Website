          Cells. They were all put together at a time. Cells. Millions and billions of them.
          Cells. Were you ever arrested? Cells. Did you spend much time in the cell? Cells. Have you ever been in an instituion?
          Cells. Do they keep you in a cell? Cells. When you're not performing your duties do they keep you in a little box?
          Cells. Interlinked. What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Interlinked. Do they teach you how to feel finger to finger?
          Interlinked. Do you long for having your heart interlinked? Interlinked. Do you dream about being interlinked?
          Have they left a place for you where you can dream? Interlinked. What's it like to hold your child in your arms?
          Interlinked. What's it like to play with your dog? Interlinked. Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing?
          Interlinked. Do you like to connect to things? Interlinked. What happens when that linkage is broken? Interlinked.
          Have they let you feel heartbreak? Interlinked. Did you buy a present for the person you love? Within cells interlinked.
          Why don't you say that three times? Within cells interlinked. Within cells interlinked. Within cells interlinked.

        <p>
          I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off (the) shoulder of Orion.
          I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate.
          All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.
